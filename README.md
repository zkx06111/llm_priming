The results for *Replicate and Compare with Humans: LLMs Represent Partial Semantic Knowledge in Pronoun Interpretation*.

The data for running the experiments are in `priming_data/`.

The responses are in `response/`, where files starting with `flan` are generated by Flan-UL2 and other files are from GPT-3 (`text-davinci-003`).

`GPT_incontext.py` is for in-context learning experiments with GPT.

`GPT_zeroinference.py` is for zero-shot inference experiments with GPT.
