# Experimental Details

## Experiment 1
**Procedure**: The survey starts from 20 of these exposure sentences, establishing the local frequency as either 100% subject-reference or 100% nonsubject-reference. Then, participants saw 12 critical test items with ambiguous pronouns intermixed with another 20 exposure stories.\
**1a**: Use unambiguous pronouns.\
**1b**: Use names to replace pronouns.\
**1c**: Use first-person and second-person pronouns to replace names and third-person pronouns.

## Experiment 2
**Procedure**: This experiment was designed to test transfer events. The main task was similar to Experiment 1. Participants read two-sentence stories about the same four characters as in Experiment 1 (Ana, Liz, Will, Matt) and answered two questions per story, one content and one reference question. Participants began with two practice questions and then began the main task. Therewere 44 total items in each list, including 12 critical items and 32 exposure items. The critical stories all involved two characters of the same gender and used an ambiguous pronoun to refer to one of these characters. The exposure stories all involved two characters of different gender, and the pronoun was unambiguous by gender.\
**2a**: subject 50% goal and 50% source\
**2b**: exposure always goal or source
